Prediction Log
===========

Prediction Log is a Startup Weekend project that gives users a platform to record, share, and discuss their predictions about all of life's events, great and small.

It is based on nileshtrivedi's Rails Starter App, a combination of https://github.com/diowa/ruby2-rails4-bootstrap-heroku and https://github.com/codecase/omniauth-rails
